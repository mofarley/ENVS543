```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library( tidyverse )
library( nycflights13 )
```

Since regression analysis is such a fundamental component of inferences, I thought it would be a good idea to try to work through a few more examples to give you some more practice.

For this we will use some data on flights into and out of Newark (EWR), JFK, and La Guardia airports in NYC metropolitan area.

```{r}
summary( flights) 
```

We also have some data related to local weather conditions.

```{r}
summary( weather )
```

I'm going to make a synthetic data set consisting of flights out of JFK for the *ExpressJet* airlines. Since the weather data is on the hour, I also make a synthetic varible `Month.Day.Hour` so that I can join the weather data to this one.

```{r}
flights %>%
  filter( origin == "JFK", carrier == "EV") %>%
  mutate( DateTime = paste(month,day,hour, sep=".")) %>%
  select( DateTime, 
          `Departure Delay` = dep_delay,
          `Departure Time` = sched_dep_time) %>%
  droplevels() -> df.jfk 
summary( df.jfk )
```

Now I'll do the same with the weather data.

```{r}
weather %>%
  filter( origin == "JFK") %>% 
  mutate( DateTime = paste(month,day,hour, sep=".")) %>%
  select( -origin, -year, -month, -day, -hour, -time_hour ) -> df.weather 
summary( df.weather )
```

Now, I'm going to `merge` these two `data.frame` objects using the common `key` I made `DateTime`.

```{r}
merge( df.jfk, df.weather, by="DateTime" ) %>%
  select( -DateTime ) -> df 

summary( df )
```

# Activity

What features of this data set may impact the departure delay for flights coming out of JFK on *ExpressJet* Airlines?

```{r}
#im imputing for NA values. I think the NA (1183 of them) values were giving me misleading results for wind direction and pressure.
data <- df %>%
  mutate(across(everything(), ~ ifelse(is.na(.), mean(., na.rm = TRUE), .)))
model <- lm(data$`Departure Delay` ~ ., data = data)
summary(model)
```

The linear model indicates (after getting rid of NA values) for significance levels of .05 that we should look at **wind speed** and **visibility** as possible factors for delays. To see how much of impact they have, we can try to isolate their r\^2 values.

```{r}
# since the summary for the total model gives one r^2 value, try to do an lm() on our significant variables individually
r2_vis <- lm(data$`Departure Delay` ~ data$visib, data = data)
r2_spd <- lm(data$`Departure Delay` ~ data$wind_speed, data = data)
r2 <- c('r2_vis' = summary(r2_vis)$r.squared, 'r2_spd' = summary(r2_spd)$r.squared)
print(r2)
```

Based on r squared values, it looks like with neither being over .5, they don't indicate very strong fits. Therefore, I would be cautious using weather factors to determine the significance of flight delays, but if I had to choose factors to look at it would be wind speed and visibility.
