## Term 1: Dynamic Systems

-   Definition: Systems that change over time, influenced by internal and external factors

-   Ecological Relevance: Interconnected components of ecosystems (e.g. populations, resources, climate, etc...)

-   Key components:

    -   Non-linearity: Small changes can lead to large effects

    -   Feedback loops: Interactions between components can amplify or dampen changes

    -   Emergent properties: complex patterns arise from simple interactions

## Term 2: Transcritical Bifurcation

-   Two states exist (one is stable, the other is unstable).

-   A smooth change in a parameter causes them to swap stability. Imagine the "smooth change" as a turning a knob.

-   Really simplified definition without getting in differential equations, eigenvalues (I'm not able to cover lol)

## Term 2: Example using \[blank\] populations

-   State A: low population & State B: high population
-   Before the switch (low knob setting): State A is stable and the population tends to stay low.
    -   State B is unstable - if the population gets too high, something (like lack of food) will cause it to crash back down.
-   After the switch (high knob setting): State B is now stable - the population tends to stay high.
    -   State A is now unstable - if the population gets too low, something (like random deaths) could wipe it out completely.
-   As you gradually increase the knob setting (maybe by introducing more food), the two populations "switch places" in terms of their stability.

## Term 3: Graph (Network)

-   A **graph** is a collection of **nodes** (vertices) connected by **edges** (links), where each edge has an associated **weight** (cost or distance). For my use (via the Bellman-Ford algorithm), the graph can be directed, and edge weights may be negative, enabling the algorithm to find the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes, even in graphs with negative weights (but no negative weight cycles).

## Applications for Moses & Applied Ecology

Analysis of invasive mutualism?

-   Spotted lantern fly and Ailanthus

-   Fig trees and wasps

-   Fir trees and fungus

## Needs for me (improvement)

-   Better understanding of bifurcation theory\\differential equations

    -   Equation crucial to the Dynamic Programming aspect is mass action disease incidence (homogeneous populations mixing) equation.

    -   

        ![Mass action disease incidence](images/equation.png){width="447"}

-   Better background on how to obtain sample data (no data availability for Torino study)

-   Figuring out locations, costs and attainable time windows.

-   Follow directions!
