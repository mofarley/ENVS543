This homework is a bit quick but is designed to make sure that:

1.  To make sure everyone can get their computer up-to-date with the proper set of libraries so that we can work with geospatial data, and
2.  Give you some practice turning normal numerical data into geospatial coordinates and performing basic operations.

## Spatial Libraries

The following code defines the set of necessary libraries for the next few weeks and then figures out which (potential) subset you need to install. It then installs them all in one call. It will not load them into your session, you'll have to do that later in your code chunks.

## The Data - Preprocessing

The data for this is some site-level data from the Sonoran Desert bark beetle. The URL is in the next chunk, and is currently being hosted on my class [Github repository](https://github.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures). Load it in.

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyerlab/ENVS-Lectures/master/data/Araptus_Disperal_Bias.csv"
```

### Interactive Map

Use the `leaflet` library and make an interactive map. If you can, add a label to each marker with the ID of the site. You can look at the provider tiles [here](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/) and use on in the `addProviderTiles()` function.

There is a great tutorial [here](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/map_widget.html) on how to customize the leaflet display. You may want to go look at it and see what you can use to make a better display.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(sf)
# make a quick leaflet map here to get an idea of 
beetles <- read.csv(url)
leaflet(data = beetles) %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # see leaflet tutorial
  addCircleMarkers(
    ~Longitude, ~Latitude,  # coords for markers
    label = ~as.character(Site),  # site column as labels
    popup = ~paste("Site:", Site, "<br>",
                   "Males:", Males, "<br>",
                   "Females:", Females),  # popup info
    radius = 5,  # size of markers
    color = "blue",  # color the markers
    fillOpacity = 0.8
  ) %>%
  addLabelOnlyMarkers(
    ~Longitude, ~Latitude,
    label = ~as.character(Site),
    labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = TRUE, direction = "top", textOnly = TRUE)
  )
```

### Converting to `sf` Objects

Convert the spatial data in the beetle data.frame into an `sf` object. Make sure you set the Coordinate Reference System to $4326$.

```{r}
#| label: beetle data cleanup
beetle_sf <- beetles %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"), crs = 4326)
print(beetle_sf)  
```

### Questions

For these questions, you may want to look at the `sf` cheat sheet [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/main/sf.pdf) to find the appropriate geospatial function.

-   How far apart (in km) are the sites Constituci√≥n (`const`) and San Francisquito (`sfran`)?

```{r}
sfr <- beetle_sf %>% filter(Site == 'sfran')
cst <- beetle_sf %>% filter(Site == 'const')
distance <- st_distance(sfr, cst)
distance_km <- as.numeric(distance) / 1000
print(distance_km)
```

-   Is there a correlation between habitat suitability and the ratio of males to female beetles sampled at each locale? *yes, it looks like there is mild negative correlation based on the pearsons coefficient of -.399.*

```{r}
cor.MtoF <- cor.test(beetles$Suitability, beetles$MFRatio)
cor.MtoF
```

-   Make a plot using `ggplot` of the data with suitability as the size of the points and the sex ratio as the fill color.

```{r}
ggplot(beetles, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = Suitability, fill = MFRatio), shape = 21, color = "black", stroke = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma", name = "M/F Ratio") +  # color scale for fill
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(2, 10), name = "Suitability") +  # change size range
  labs(title = "Beetle Habitat Suitability and MtoF Ratio",
       x = "Longitude",
       y = "Latitude") +
  theme_minimal()
```

-   Reproject the data and plot it again using an EPSG code defined for Mexico UTM zone 12N (see [epgs.io](https://epsg.io) for projections).

```{r}
beetle_sf_utm <- st_transform(beetle_sf, crs = 32612)
ggplot(beetle_sf_utm) +
  geom_sf(aes(size = Suitability, fill = MFRatio), shape = 21, color = "black", stroke = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma", name = "M/F Ratio") +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(2, 10), name = "Suitability") +
  labs(title = "Beetle Habitat Suitability and Male-to-Female Ratio (UTM Zone 12N)",
       x = "Eastward (m)",
       y = "Northward (m)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
cor.response <- cor.test( iris$Petal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
```

We failed to find a significant relationship between sepal length and width (Pearson Correlation, $\rho$ = `r cor.response$estimate`, P = `r cor.response$p.value`).
